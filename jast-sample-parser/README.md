# JAST Sample parser (what should be generated)
This module is just a demonstration of the parser build on top of the principle of type-safe active heterogeneous stack
and transitions implemented using visitor pattern.

The code here may look overwhelming. For the purpose of the demo, it was developed manually. But the whole ide of
JAST-agic is to generate the parser code (in fact the states, and token wrappers) based on the abstract syntax tree
hierarchy, as defined in the AST factory.

So when looking at the module source, there are these important remarks:

- Package `foundation.fluent.jast.sample.ast` contains representation of all abstract syntax tree constructs (nodes) in
 the custom form, and `AstFactory` used to create them. As visible there, the factory methods accept also nodes not used
 in the AST, but artificially defining the grammar.
 
- Packages `fountation.fluent.jast.sample.states` and `fountation.fluent.jast.sample.tokens` contain the necessary code
 implementing the parser. This code is to be generated by JAST-agic.

As JAST-agic is now under development, the generator is not yet ready.
